## Concept
Isn't space awesome? Well I think it is. That is why I made a multiplayer game where you can fly in space with your own rocket and discover planets. The solar system in this game is a real scale model of our solar system using an API that gives data about every planet and all of there moons.

## API
The [L'OpenData du Syst√®me Solaire](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/en/) is a French API. Luckely they have an English page so I could still understand how to use it. This API can be called using [](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/rest/bodies/). It is a really simple API.
