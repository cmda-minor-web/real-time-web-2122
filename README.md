## Concept
Isn't space awesome? Well I think it is. That is why I made a multiplayer game where you can fly in space with your own rocket and discover planets. The solar system in this game is a real scale model of our solar system using an API that gives data about every planet and all of there moons.

## API
The [L'OpenData du Système Solaire](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/en/) is a French API. Luckely they have an English page so I could still understand how to use it. This API can be called using [https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/rest/bodies/](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/rest/bodies/). It is a really simple API.

## Features

### Current Features
- [x] Create username
- [x] Move rocket by mouse (mouse further from rocket means faster!)
- [x] Toggle movement by pressing `Space`
- [x] Rotate rocket to mouse position
- [x] Coördinates of rocket (top left of screen)
- [x] Planets are positioned using the API for a real scale model of our solar system (using **perihelion**)
- [x] Planets orbit around the sun using `transform: rotate()` (using **sideralOrbit**)
- [x] Pinpoints for every planet so you can always find every planet
- [x] Multiple users can join.
- [x] Updating position and rotation of every rocket to every client

### Future Features
- [ ] Updating position of every planet to every client (every client has their own planet rotation. Info needs to be send using sockets)🌍
- [ ] A chat in the left bottom corner so people can actually talk to each other 😊
- [ ] Changing the "lightspeed" of your rocket so you can travel faster and slower ⚡️
- [ ] Create your own rocket 🚀
- [ ] Fire of rocket only appears when you actually fly 🔥
- [ ] Adding aliens, meteor showers, satellites and maybe the Tesla car in space? 👽 ☄️ 🛰
- [ ] Less consistent stars background ✨
- [ ] Add moons to the planets 🌙

### Bug fixes I want to do
- [x] Pinpoints move kind of buggy (the faster you go, the more they bug) *UPDATE: it is a little bit better now (but still not optimal)*
- [ ] Movement and rotation of other players is lagging
- [ ] Sometimes no rocket is shown when joining with username
- [ ] If user is on start menu and a new user joins, the rocket of the new user is in front of form 
- [ ] Just refactoring my code, client side javascript is kind of messy

## Real Time Events

### Connection
When connecting to the server an array of every user online is rendered in ejs. Also the position of every users rocket is sent and kept updated.
```
io.on('connection', function (socket) {
    socket.emit('data', newData);
    socket.on('new user', username => {
        let object = {username: username, id: socket.id};
        userList.push(object);
        io.emit("new user", object);
    })
    socket.on('position', pos => {
        io.emit("position", pos);
    })
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        io.emit('user left', {id: socket.id})
        userList = userList.filter(user => user.id !== socket.id );
    })
});
```

### New user
If a user puts in a username and submits the form, the name of the user is sent to the server.
```
userForm.addEventListener('submit', e => {
    if (usernameInput.length > 0) {
        socket.emit('new user', usernameInput);
    }
});
```
The server pushes the username and the socket id of the client into an array and sends the object back to every client.
```
socket.on('new user', username => {
    let object = {username: username, id: socket.id};
    userList.push(object);
    io.emit("new user", object);
})
```

### Disconnect
When a user disconnects from the server the user gets removed from the users array and client side being removed for every client.
```
socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    io.emit('user left', {id: socket.id})
    userList = userList.filter(user => user.id !== socket.id );
})

socket.on('user left', user => {
    document.querySelector(`#${user.id}`).remove()
});
```
